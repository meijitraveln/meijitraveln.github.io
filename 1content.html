    <h1>Tour the The Imperial Palace</h1>
    <p>The current Imperial Palace (皇居, Kōkyo) is located on the former site of Edo Castle, a large park area surrounded by moats and massive stone walls in the center of Tokyo, a short walk from Tokyo Station. It is the residence of Japan's Imperial Family.</p>
    <p>Edo Castle used to be the seat of the Tokugawa shogun who ruled Japan from 1603 until 1867. In 1868, the shogunate was overthrown, and the country's capital and Imperial Residence were moved from Kyoto to Tokyo. In 1888 construction of a new Imperial Palace was completed. The palace was once destroyed during World War Two, and rebuilt in the same style, afterwards.</p>
    <p>From Kokyo Gaien, the large plaza in front of the Imperial Palace, visitors can view the Nijubashi, two bridges that form an entrance to the inner palace grounds. The stone bridge in front is called Meganebashi (Eyeglass Bridge) for its looks. The bridge in the back was formerly a wooden bridge with two levels, from which the name Nijubashi (Double Bridge) is derived.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h1>The Old palace</h1>
    <p>In the Meiji period, most structures from the Edo Castle disappeared. Some were cleared to make way for other buildings while others were destroyed by earthquakes and fire. For example, the wooden double bridges (二重橋, Nijūbashi) over the moat were replaced with stone and iron bridges. The buildings of the Imperial Palace constructed in the Meiji era were constructed of wood. Their design employed traditional Japanese architecture in their exterior appearance while the interiors were an eclectic mixture of fashionable Japanese and European elements. The ceilings of the grand chambers were coffered with Japanese elements; however, Western chairs, tables and heavy curtains furnished the spaces. The floors of the public rooms had parquets or carpets while the residential spaces used traditional tatami mats.</p>

    <h1>Getting there and around</h1>
    <p>If you’re heading straight over from Tokyo Station, it’s a simple 10-minute walk from the Marunouchi Central Exit (not Yaesu), heading out onto Gyoko-dori and heading straight down to the Wadakura-mon Gate.

If you’re wanting to register for a palace tour, you need to head to the Kikyomon gate, which is a 10-minute walk from Nijubashimae Station or Otemachi Station via the Otemon Gate, or 15 minutes from Tokyo Station.

For the northern area, you can head to Kudanshita Station for the Nippon Budokan and Science Museum or Takebashi Station for the National Museum of Modern Art.</p>
